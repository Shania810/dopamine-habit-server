The Dopamine Habit 

Mainly here you'll find the API that hosts our list of challenges, as well as the many routes used to make nagivating through the app easy. 

You'll find the route to the signup page and the login page, which can both be found on the home page. Once logged in as a user in our database, you'll be redirected to the challenged page. 

There is where you'll find a list of about 30 different challenges that are meant to be accessible to all. From exercising to developing a reading habit, you'll find challenges with clear descriptions. 
These challenges also contain a time frame we believe to be ideal for the creation and keeping of that particular habit. Along with this time frame is a suggestion of frquency. 
While just a suggestion, we hope that you will take a quick look to see what we think to be ideal when it comes to practicing that particular activiy. We promise you that we made it reasonable - because we understand that sustainability is more important that throwing you into the wolves to sprint down the finish line. 

Once in the challenges area, if adding a challenge to your habits you'll be redirected to the "my habits" page. There you'll find just that - your habits. Those you've added manually and those you picked from our database in "challenges". 

At the top you'll see the user profile - you - which can be modified at anytime. From adding a profile picture to changing your username or password, this area will cover all your user needs. 

Finally, the analysis route will lead to a 7-day analysis of your habits. A bar graph will give you visual representation of what you've been up to. From there, week after week, you can then choose what habits you want to keep or ditch. 

Have fun!
